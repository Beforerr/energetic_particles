keV up to GeV

- acceleration
  - flares in the solar corona
  - interplanetary shocks
- transport
  - drift motion
  - pitch-angle scattering
    - turbulence (fluctuation amplitude, spectral index, anisotropy, intermittency...)
      - theory
        - @matthaeusNonlinearCollisionlessPerpendicular2003
      - observations
    - coherent structures
      - numerical simulations
        - @malaraChargedparticleChaoticDynamics2021
          - trapping times have a nearly **power-law** distribution
  - observations
    - associations with coherent structures
      - SEP modulations
        - @trenchiSolarEnergeticParticle2013, @neugebauerEnergeticParticlesTangential2015
        - EP boundaries occur at large-scale TDs [@neugebauerEnergeticParticlesTangential2015] (for EP boundaries that were not located at interplanetary shocks or caused by intermittent connection to the Earthâ€™s bow shock)



Superdiffusive transport parallel due to the pitch-angle scattering times having a non-Markovian, **power-law** probability distribution
